\section{Introduction and Problem Statement}
Today, file synchronization and storage is demanded more than ever. The average user owns multiple devices that are continuously connected to the internet and uses the device which is the most practical for his current situation. As a consequence, users require their files to be up-to-date at all times regardless of which device the user wants to access the files on. A second aspect is that there is an ever increasing demand for systems which allow file sharing between users, such that multiple people can work on the same files independently, whether at the same time or not.

In general, the existing file synchronization and storage systems can be categorized into two groups: Client-Server based distributed file storage systems (also sometimes referred to as Cloud storage systems) and Peer-to-Peer file storage systems. Since giving a comprehensive treatment to both of those categories would be beyond the scope of this seminar thesis, the focus here lies on Peer-to-Peer file storage systems, henceforth called P2P file storage systems.

This seminar thesis aims to give an overview over the current available P2P file storage systems to categorize them according to their different aspects. In chapter \ref{sec:background} we want to give an impression of the background of peer-to-peer systems including historical aspects, manly predecessor approaches of file storage solutions. Chapter \ref{sec:approach} reveals the procedures and approaches used in this thesis to justify the decision made for the chosen systems for comparing and for in detail listing the criteria these systems where compared with each other and finally giving examples and reasons for the criteria and point out their importance. The four chosen peer-to-peer systems; Storj, AeroFS, Hive2Hive and BitTorrentSync will be described in chapter \ref{comparisons} among the chosen criteria. The findings will also be summarized on the base of comparing the assets and drawbacks of these systems and by comparison to Dropbox, a popular distributed file storage system.

\section{Background} % @Josua
\label{sec:background}
This section gives a short basic overview over the most important topics concerning P2P systems, file storage, and the special requirements of P2P file storage systems compared to those of traditional and distributed file storage. Conclusive the most common drawbacks of these previous but still used systems compared to peer-to-peer systems is shown.

\subsection{File Storage}
It is difficult to find a good definition for file storage, the following one is more general and not too technical. Hence The Free Dictionary defines file storage as follows:
\begin{quote}
A generic term for warehousing electronic files. It may refer to local storage in a PC or tablet or remote storage on the Internet. The primary storage devices are hard drives and solid state drives\cite{thefreedictionary}.
\end{quote}
To begin with an overview of the different approaches for file storage and some historical aspects there are basically three different file storage generations classified. Afterwards it is often talked about distributed file storage (DFS) meaning that file storage is not managed by only one system that is geographically constraint. When talking about cloud a metaphorical synonym for DFS is intended.

Firstly, talking about traditional or \textit{Client-Server file storage}, also called \textbf{1st generation DFS}, systems where the cloud consists of one or multiple huge file server storing all the files of multiple clients being on the same network are opined. The main problem in such systems is the file server itself acting as a \textit{single point of failure} and thus becomes a \textit{bottleneck}, illustrated in figure \ref{1st_gen_dfs}.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Talk5/1st_gen_dfs.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{1st Generation DFS \cite{wikimedia:p2p}}
		\label{1st_gen_dfs}
	\end{figure}
\textit{Distributed file systems} known as \textbf{2nd generation DFS}, not to confuse with distributed file storage, show some similarities to the traditional system except files being stored on a cluster of servers, so each server stores parts of the original files. In general RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is used to hopefully avoid storage medium failure and enhance data throughput. These systems are known to be symmetric and scalable. Scalable is an indicator for how easy it is to add endpoints to a system. Figure \ref{2nd_gen_dfs} shows an scheme of a distributed file system.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Talk5/2nd_gen_dfs.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{2nd Generation DFS}
		\label{2nd_gen_dfs}
	\end{figure}
The \textbf{3rd generation DFS}, namely \textit{peer-to-peer systems} in general do not have such a clear structure and separation between clients and servers. Each peer, also called node, which means each device connected to the network being able to store or access data on that network is connected to other peers, see figure \ref{3rd_gen_dfs}. The whole system is self-organizing, autonomous and heterogeneous. Heterogeneity in the sense of what systems are within such a network and what bandwidth rate is available, meaning it does not matter whether a node is a powerful server on broadband or a mobile device on it's mobile network. Autonomy and self-organization is the basic principle and indicator for P2P systems and describes the process how other peers can be discovered and how the network itself sets up. Peers can give access, read and or write to other peers to specific files and folders, and as long as the peers providing the data are connected to the network the files are accessible.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Talk5/3rd_gen_dfs.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{3rd Generation DFS \cite{wikimedia:p2p}}
		\label{3rd_gen_dfs}
	\end{figure}
As each approach of distributed file storage may have his benefits there is no system without drawbacks or even constraints. This is one of the main reasons why first and second generation DFS are still omnipresent, but peer-to-peer technology is on the increase as technology progresses and acceptance and mistrust of society disappears.

\subsection{Peer-to-Peer}
In this section a deeper understanding of the main ideas and goals of Peer-to-Peer systems will be given. Tough it is not possible to go very deep in this topic, the idea is to give an overview and a basis for the related work in following sections. First of all a very detailed definition of what Peer-to-Peer systems can be described as is given. Later it is explained what type of peering scheme exist and in the end a summary of the well known assets and drawbacks of peer-to-peer systems compared to traditional cloud storage is done.
\begin{quote}
A distributed network architecture may be called a Peer-to-Peer (P-to-P, P2P,...) network, if the participants share a part of their own hardware resources (processing power, storage capacity, network link capacity, printers,...). These shared resources are necessary to provide the Service and content offered by the network (e.g. file sharing or shared workspaces for collaboration). They are accessible by other peers directly, without passing intermediary entities. The participants of such a network are thus resource (Service and content) providers as well as resource (Service and content) requestors (Servent-concept)\cite{ptp:definition}.
\end{quote}
Apparently the concept behind P2P systems is to move away from the traditional client-server architecture to get as far away from their withdrawals as possible. Instead of having one machine acting as a server only answering requests by clients when these clients send those requests, in P2P, the roles of the client and server are combined into one machine (hereforth called peer). Peers then can form a network of peers, i.e., a peer-to-peer network.

There are some well-known advantages and disadvantages in peer-to-peer systems. As for traditional distributed file storage the server can become the single point of failure and RAID networks are expensive and sophisticated to maintain whereas peer-to-peer networks do not have to deal with all of these problems. P2P systems naturally are scalable and excellent in fault tolerance what needs to be archived heavy-going for centralized systems. Nonetheless peer-to-peer systems are quite difficult to manage and good security is hard to archive but having these concerns controlled by a single instance like it is for centralized systems, it is easy to obtain \cite{tomp2p:p2p_introduction}.

Generally four different types of P2P networks are classified. Mostly it is not possible to clearly associate a known system to only one of these four basic approaches because most systems on the market do not provide such a clear structure or use multiple approaches. Nonetheless usually one approach sticks out \cite{ptp-introduction:tomptp}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Centralized P2P} as indicated in figure \ref{centralized_p2p} shows similarities to the classical client-server model where peers in fact communicate directly with each other but with the help of a central server. A good known service as an example for centralized P2P is Napster which uses central peer serves as directories. AeroFS, one of the systems later in detail discussed uses a similar approach too.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Talk5/centralized_p2p.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Centralized peer-to-peer}
		\label{centralized_p2p}
	\end{figure}
	\item \textbf{Hybrid P2P} provides so called \textit{super peers} to find other peers and resources. Peers communicate to these super peers until the resource is found and thus the peers can communicate directly. This paper does not cover any detailed discussion of a hybrid system but a well known service is for example Sykpe. Figure \ref{hybrid_p2p} illustrates a hybrid approach:
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Talk5/hybrid_p2p.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Hybrid peer-to-peer}
		\label{hybrid_p2p}
	\end{figure}
	\item \textbf{Pure P2P} systems, also known as \textit{unstructured P2P} systems are systems where all peers are equally powerful communicating without any server or super peer, so peers communicate directly and act as relays to find demanded resources. BitTorrentSync and Storj, both systems that will be discussed in detail in a moment are systems which use a pure P2P approach as shown in figure \ref{pure_p2p}:
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Talk5/pure_p2p.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Pure (unstructured) peer-to-peer}
		\label{pure_p2p}
	\end{figure}
	\item \textbf{Structured P2P} as shown in figure \ref{structured_p2p} are similar to pure P2P however the peers are organized in a specific structure, e.g. a tree, often a DHT which is used to enhance peer and resource detection. A DHT is just like a normal hash table where hashes of the keys are stored and these keys indicate on which peer the requested files are. Each peer is responsible for a specific key range and henceforth is called \textit{distributed hash table}.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Talk5/structured_p2p.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Structured peer-to-peer}
		\label{structured_p2p}
	\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

Peer-to-peer networks often lack of having enough peers continuously connected to the network. Where peers are defined as some volunteers helping for important files enable fast transfer speed.

\subsection{Problems of Common Sync and Sharing Services}
File synchronization has do address and deal with several problems. Depending on the type of file storage and synchronization that is used, some problems might be easy to address and some are even impossible to fully cover. In traditional file storage for example the main problem is the server itself which becomes a bottleneck and is vulnerable to targeted attacks e.g. DDOS (distributed denial of service) attacks. Private data on these large, external data centers is often not encrypted or if it is, the keys are stored on the same server too, as will be shown later in the example of Dropbox. Users do not have control over who can access their private data and he or she is bound to the respective pricing and terms of the service. Such systems often lack of version control and conflict management \cite{hive2hive}.

Depending on the peering scheme used: e.g. manageability gets more complicated as it is for pure P2P and availability is downscaled in centralized P2P where the server again becomes a bottleneck. But for all peering schemes trust is a big talking point. As it is proven to successfully undermine powerful and well secured servers it is just a logic implication that for peers, which represent normal household computational devices, manipulation must be much simpler.

\section{Approach} % @Simon
\label{sec:approach}
In the first place our reasons and a justification for the chosen systems is provided. 
In addition the criteria we chose to classify the different file storage systems are listed and stated below. As we decided to compare only few systems but dig as well as in any way possible into these systems we have considered listing as many relevant criteria as we could find.

\subsection{Justification of the chosen systems}
During research discovering so many peer-to-peer systems a selection of a few of them was inevitable. The criteria among that was chosen for evaluation where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Availability and maturity} -- \textit{Is the system currently available and are the concepts developed and implemented and not only ideas?}\\
If there are good documentations or papers of the systems to be able to cover as many criteria as possible was an important point.

\item \textbf{Academic or commercial release} -- \textit{Was or is the system being developed for academical and research purposes or is the main approach commercial?}\\
We wanted to have a good mixture of academical and commercial systems.

\item \textbf{Importance in future} -- \textit{Does the system show 'skills', meaning well-wrought functionalities which indicate that it might play an important role in future?}\\
Admitting this criteria is difficult to guess it is important to chose a system that does not shut down in the foreseeable future.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Criteria}
The decision of criteria was made to fit what we feel are the most important aspects that a prospective user considers before making the decision of which file storage system to use. The following criteria were chosen for classification and a justification for each choice is given.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \textbf{Peering Scheme} -- \textit{How are peers connected, where is user data stored, how do users communicate and what messages do they exchange?}\\
This classification criteria describes the technical aspects of the peer-to-peer system. As described in Section 2 (include reference) there are many different forms of peering schemes for peer-to-peer networks. It also may be important for users to know how and where their data is physically stored in the network. Some users may be weary of storing their personal data on the machine of a stranger, even if the data is divided into chunks and encrypted. This aspect also deals with how peers can share data with each other and which communication possibilities exist. 

\item \textbf{Encryption} -- \textit{Are the communication between peers and the files stored encrypted and with which algorithm?}\\
Personal data is the gold of the 21st century, for that reason encryption play a main role in digital communication, data exchange and and storage. The kind of encryption algorithm chosen determines the time needed for brute-force decryption of a file. Bad or even incomplete encryption may lead to a rude awakening in future when sensitive data gets into the wrong hands. This aspect tries to analyze encryption in data transmission and storage from a critical point of view for each chosen system.

\item \textbf{Trust and Integrity} -- \textit{How is trust established between peers? How are files and communication protected against fraudulent users and attacks?}\\
For a peer it is most important to know whether the peer he is connected to is trustworthy or not. As security on private machines is a hard thing to achieve, the best strategy would be to avoid communication with possible evil peers. If the files are manipulated, the P2P system must detect this misuse and automatically initiate a recovery process.

\item \textbf{Payment Scheme} -- \textit{Is the system free or paid? Who gets paid what under which circumstances?}\\
Of course, a user is more likely to use a system the cheaper it is. However, there is also the possibility for users to earn money, e.g., by offering up their excess storage space.

\item \textbf{Fairness} -- \textit{How is the workload distributed in the system especially considering the heterogeneous hardware used by the peers?}\\
When all data was stored on one peer, we would have a bottleneck again. To avoid this as effective as possible data, i.e.g. file chunks need to be evenly distributed among peers. Also bandwidth and computational power or the type of storage medium may play a role in workload distribution.

\item \textbf{Fault-tolerance and Availability} -- \textit{How does the system guarantee that files are available to the users at all time?}\\
The system should handle network failures and prevent data loss when a peer just shuts off the network. Users are impatient and do not want to wait for hours until they can access their data otherwise they probably will drop the system and look for a better solution.

\item \textbf{Type of Distribution} -- \textit{Is the system only a library or a dedicated software client?}\\
This aspect determines the ease of use of the system, but also if a expert user can build his or her own application on top of the provided system.

\item \textbf{Source code availability} -- \textit{Is the system open-source or closed source?}\\
This aspect is most relevant to application developers but might also be of interest for conventional users. If a system is open source, an application developers can make changes to the program code and may also contribute to future releases of the system. However, this can also be detrimental. Programmers may be able to change certain parts of their application which in turn may bypass security and fairness concepts normally applied in the system. For example, it might be possible for a malicious programmer to disable storage of data from other users while he or she stores large amounts of data of their own on other peers. In a different, more extreme example, a malicious programmer can commit changes to the public source code that contains backdoors to the encryption algorithms, allowing the programmer to access files which he or she is not normally authorized to access. The feasibility of this example depends on how many people are involved with the development of the open source project and how skilled the owners of the code are at detecting such malicious changes.
Closed source code can also be disadvantageous. If the source code is not accessible, users have to trust the developer that the security algorithms are properly implemented and that their data is only accessible to authorized parties. With open source code, an adept user can at all times verify the quality of the security scheme. Also, the more developers that are actively working on the open source project and verifying commits, the smaller is the possibility of malicious code sneaking in.

\item \textbf{User base} -- \textit{How many users does the system currently have? Is the system intended for businesses or private users?}\\
Firstly, the amount of users already using the system may be an indication of the quality of the system to prospective users. Also, there exists the network effect which may make it more useful for users to use a system which is already widely established instead of one which is only used by few people. Additionally, an open source system with many active users and developers may be more secure than ones with a smaller install base. However, a larger user base also makes the system a more desirable target of attack for malicious users. Secondly, the feature set of a system can also be geared more towards business applications instead of private users. It is usually more prudent to choose a system that is more suitable to the goals of the user.

\item \textbf{Status} -- \textit{In what state is the system? Is it available for use, a scientific prototype or canceled?}\\
A system should be available for use or at least available in near future. Digital senescence of systems not used anymore should not be underrated also since data storage is often not meant to last only for a few months or years. Scientific prototypes are important to get to know what the current point of technology is able to achieve and thus have a possible view into the future where more systems with such approaches may be used.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparisons}
\label{comparisons}
In this section, we classify and compare four exemplary P2P file storage systems according to the classification criteria given in the preceding section. We also compare the P2P file storage to a popular distributed file storage system to find similarities and differences. At the end, we give a summary of the findings and highlight those findings in a table comparing the file storage systems with each other.

\subsection{Storj} % @Josua
One can describe Storj (pronounced storage) as a completely decentralized and blockchain-based peer-to-peer cloud storage system with it's major concern on security and efficiency. Being primary launched in July 2014 it further includes a peer-to-peer payment system service similar to Bitcoin \cite{storj:blog:what_is_storj}. Storj mainly consists of two applications, namely DriveShare (also called Driveminer) and Metadisk. The former uses unused hard drive space of users and the latter is a web-service used for file storage and sharing. The main approach of Storj claims that the average user has a lot of unused hard drive space and for many systems a user pays for a specific amount of space even if he or she doesn't use it at all. Storj further claims a user is only obligated to pay for his used space and thus will be much cheaper than any other available cloud storage.

\textbf{Peering scheme:} There are no centralized servers but information of where other shards of a specific file are located is stored in the Storj blockchain. In the blockchain itself no files but only meta-data (file hashes) for file lookup are stored. A blockchain is very hard to manipulate as every peer gets a copy of it. Peer discovery is done by an advertisement system whose functionality is not explained in precision \cite{storj:PDF}. Storj remains as unstructured peer-to-peer system using the blockchain as reference for file discovery.

\textbf{Encryption:} Before encryption and distribution files are splitted into so called shards. These shards, a multiple of 8 or 32 Bit-sized file chunks, are being added a deterministic salt, then uniquely encrypted and distributed over the network. A farmer, which means a hard drive space providing peer, does not get a whole copy of a file (all necessary shards to compose the original file) but the shards are distributed to multiple farmers. Per default there are at least three redundant copies of a shard all the time available. For enhanced security for sensitive or important data it is also possible to combine shards, e.g. with garbage data or other client's data. The prof of redundancy claims if a node goes offline a copy of all it's shards is made and the shards moved to another node. In addition a user can chose how and with what his files will be encrypted  \cite{storj:PDF}.

\textbf{Trust and Integrity} With the help of a \textit{pseudo-reputation system} like advertisements in peer discovery to get data quality and type by tracking it or directly from the network, evaluations are made to detect and qualify reputable peers. A peer is reputable if it is marked as trustworthy by the algorithm. Storj uses a recommendation system for peers to improve the algorithm \cite{storj:PDF}.

The \textit{proof of storage} via \textit{merkle audits}, also audits through \textit{hash challenge} ensure whether a farmer is able to proof he holds a specific file, or more precise; a specific shard and that the shard has not been changed or maliciously modified by anyone or anything. A merkle tree is a hash tree where every non-leaf node is labeled with the hash of the labels of its children nodes, so to ensure whether a child is correct it is sufficient to ensure whether the parent node has a correct hash.

Storj uses different so called \textit{heartbeats} to check whether a file is correctly shattered and stored. Shards are furthermore split into pieces and checked for fulfillment of the security requirements and modification detection through heartbeats as shown in figure \ref{storj_heartbeat}. A \textit{full heartbeat} means the whole shard integrity is checked but this is shown to be very I/O inefficient whereas \textit{cycle heartbeats} need \textsl{n} heartbeats to generate a full heartbeat. Deterministically generate reads on a shard using a root seed is the third variant for those audits (\textit{cycle heartbeat}), but Storj uses a mixed methodology to improve efficiency.

	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Talk5/storj_heartbeat.PNG}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Heartbeat shard audit \cite{storj:PDF}}
		\label{storj_heartbeat}
	\end{figure}

But what happens if a malicious farmer knows the decryption key of a specific file? He won't be able to complete the audits (heartbeats) for all shards since he isn't assigned to all of them. In addition this leads to the \textit{prove of redundancy} of particular shards which means that each copy of a shard is unique \cite{storj:PDF}.

\textbf{Payment scheme:} On DriveShare users, the so called farmers, can lease their unused available hard drive space and get paid for this service in Storjcoin X (SJCX), that is based on Bitcoin. SJCX rewards, depending on the current crowdsale phase, are between 38'500 and 32480 SJCX per Bitcoin\cite{storj:crowdsale}. Users of Metadisk will pay bitcoin (BTC) for these hard drive space to be able to share their files.

\textbf{Fairness:} Storj has no central devices and through the \textit{Proof-of-Redundancy} it is guaranteed that the files are evenly distributed. Also prices can vary on the base of bandwidth speed and location of the peer and type of hardware provided \cite{storj:PDF}.

\textbf{Fault-tolerance and Availability:} To default there are thee copies of a shard all times accessible which means a shard gets copied to another node if a node goes offline. The user can request more copies in exchange of money. In this way, if a node fails an audit or is unreachable, the \textit{network replication process} is initiated and thus the network is able to 'heal' itself.

To archive accordance of file location and integrity over the whole network a blockchain like Bitcoin according to Satoshi Nakamoto \cite{bitcoin} is used. The following citation illustrates the basic principle behind a blockchain:

\begin{quotation}
To use a basic analogy, it is easy to steal a cookie from a cookie jar in a secluded area, but it is hard to do so when the jar is instead located in the middle of a public square, being observed by thousands of people \cite{storj:PDF}.
\end{quotation}

\textbf{Type of distribution:} As mentioned above Storj consists of two applications; DriveShare and Metadisk.

\textbf{Source code availability:} Both applications (and even more Storj applications) are fully open-source \cite{storj:github}.

\textbf{User base:} There is no official up-to-date data, in addition the system is currently in beta-phase. The forum of Storj has over one thousand members \cite{storj:forum} and lets assume that there are currently even more storj users. In June 2014 Storj had about more than 3'000 users \cite{storj:crowdsale}.

\textbf{Status:} Storj is currently in beta phase and already available for use. There are three different test groups; A, B and C each with different conditions in terms of a rewarding system, requirements and the starting date. The official launch and avery change in beta phase is planned when a specific amount of SJCX in total has been earned \cite {storj:earlyaccess}.

\subsection{Hive2Hive} % @Simon 
Hive2Hive, formerly known as Box2Box, is an open source peer-to-peer file sharing and synchronization library that started out as part of a course challenge task project and was further improved in a graduate student's project at the Communication Systems Group at the University of Zurich (https://github.com/Hive2Hive/Hive2Hive/wiki/About-Us). It is built on top of the TomP2P library (an open source Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based key-value store) which was also developed at the Communication Systems Group. (http://tomp2p.net/)

\textbf{Peering Scheme}
Structured P2P based on the TomP2P DHT. Each peer has an id. Files are divided into chunks, a random id is generated for each chunk and stored in the metadata file of the file, the chunk is stored at the peer with the id closest to the hashed id of the chunk. The metadata file is also stored in the dht, but is only accessible to the creator of the file. ...

\textbf{Encryption}
AES for symmetrical, RSA for asymmetrical
The keys are stored in the user identity file stored in the dht, which is only accessible by the user which the identity belongs to.

\textbf{Trust \& Integrity}
There are two types of file access permission that can be given to other peers, read access and read/write access. Peers without any of those permissions cannot access a file. File chunks are signed with an MD5 hash to guarantee integrity. Peers have to verify the identity of the peers that they want to share files with themselves.

\textbf{Payment Scheme}
Hive2Hive is open source and is like most open source software free of charge to use.

\textbf{Fairness}
Since ids for file chunks are generated randomly, the file chunks are distributed equally between all peers in the long run. No prevention from peers storing an extraordinary amount of files

\textbf{Fault-tolerance and Availability}
File chunks are replicated 3 times but higher amounts can be configured

\textbf{Type of Distribution}
Hive2Hive itself is a library that provides that functionality of file sharing and synchronization. However, an end-user GUI application called Peerwasp (http://www.peerwasp.com/) is currently in development that uses Hive2Hive as a basis.

\textbf{Source code availability}
The source code of Hive2Hive, TomP2P as well as Peerwasp is freely available on Github. (https://github.com/Hive2Hive/Hive2Hive) (https://github.com/tomp2p/TomP2P) (https://github.com/PeerWasp/PeerWasp)

\textbf{User base}
No idea

\textbf{Status}
Mature library with active development

\subsection{BitTorrent Sync} % @Simon

\textbf{Peering Scheme}
There is not really a network. Files cannot be stored per se, only synchronized between multiple devices. But sharing is also possible. One device which contains the file must be online for synchronization to happen.

\subsection{AeroFS} % @Josua
AeroFS is a dedicated software client from Air Computing providing basic peer to peer solutions but some advanced functionality concerning advanced security and encryption, error and data loss prevention and intends to provide the service for low costs. AeroFS is mainly targeted towards business users and companies who need a secure file backup and synchronization service \cite{aerofs}. AeroFS in addition claims to be the 'peer-to-peer version' of Dropbox.

\textbf{Peering scheme:} AeroFS uses a centralized solution as peering scheme but let's the user chose how this will be managed. Air Computing provides two different cloud options and an additional addon, the Team Server:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Private Cloud}: Provides private Web Administration, the AeroFS Appliance which is a lightweight virtual machine to manage registration and authentication of users and private Certificate Authority (CA) to manage the AeroFS public key infrastructure (PKI) for client applications.
\item \textbf{Hybrid Cloud}: Supplies a centrally managed file sharing platform for the employees; registration, authentication and user management is done outside the network by AeroFS.
\item \textbf{Team Server} (optional Addon): Lightweight client to enable backup of files and 24/7 availability \cite{aerofs:cloud_types}. But the Team Server again has three different options:
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item \textbf{Linked Storage}: Creates a read/write copy of organization's files on the Team Server. Files will still be browseable.
	\item \textbf{Block Storage}: Compresses and de-duplicates files for enlarged disk space. Files won't be browseable anymore.
	\item \textbf{S3 Storage}: Data shared by users of an organization is stored and backed up on Amazon servers compressed and de-duplicated. Files won't be browseable anymore \cite{aerofs:storage_types}.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Encryption:} An \textit{end-to-end encryption} solution is provided, files are encrypted before transaction using AES-256 with 2048-bit RSA and only the recipient is able to decrypt the data transfer \cite{aerofs:security}. The files for syncing itself are eventually stored unencrypted. On the servers of AeroFS are - depending on the solution used - only usernames, the hashes of the passwords and the names of the access authorized users from folders stored (hybrid) \cite{aerofs:security_2}.

\textbf{Trust and Integrity} The amount of users from a borrower is of fixed size (but can grow), also using the AeroFS Applicance as root certificate, no other footprint will be accepted by the clients \cite{aerofs:security}. AeroFS provides three different access permission:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Owners (poject administrators): Can add and remove members to the shared folder.
\item Editors: Can create and modify content.
\item Viewers: Can only red content.
\end{enumerate}
A user can manage AeroFS  public key infrastructure (PKI) with his AeroFS Appliance as the root certificate authority (CA). The clients are configured to trust only this AeroFS Appliance which limits the trust footprint. AeroFS also provides an option to remove and wipe data on stolen devices.

\textbf{Payment scheme:} The basic pricing plan (Team) is free up to a user-base size of 30 \cite{aerofs:blog:30_users_free} and the business plan starts above 31 users and according to the size of the user-base the billing is done; a user costs \$15, so e.g. for 40 users the cost totals in \$600, the biggest available size on the website is 1000 users for \$15'000 per month \cite{aerofs:pricing}.

\textbf{Fault-tolerance and Availability:} Multiple users can work on the same file and conflicts are resolved by the users itself by comparing the changes and thus resolve the conflicts. But the AeroFS Appliance and the AeroFS Servers act as single point of failure and no user will be able to register and authenticate anymore.

\textbf{Fairness:} AeroFS introduces a load balancer for the AeroFS Appliance which acts as a single API endpoint and securely forwards API requests to running Team Servers and desktop clients. This load balancer thus tries to distribute the workload evenly by maintaining the balance between service availability and data consistency.
If a hard drive gets too full, the versioning systems of the AeroFS Team Server keeps track of the oldest copies and deletes them if the user runs out of space \cite{aerofs:USTO.RE}.

\textbf{Type of distribution:} AeroFS serves a software client and the AeroFS Appliance for users and a admin dash panel for enhanced manageability.

\textbf{Source code availability:} AeroFS is currently closed source but there are some interresting open-source projects on the AeroFS github page.

\textbf{User base:} According to the webpage \cite{aerofs} there are currently around \textbf{50'000\textsc{+}} users.

\textbf{Status:} Available for use and costs-free (depending on type of use).

\subsection{Dropbox}
As comparison to the previously described P2P systems the well-known file hosting service Dropbox that was founded in 2007 will be used as representation for classical cloud storage solutions and measured among the same criteria. Both, cloud storage and file synchronization are possible with this service with again both, a browser-based and a client application.

\textbf{Peering Scheme:} Dropbox does not use any peer-to-peer technology but rather a client-server system. The data is stored in the Amazon S3 cloud. An accounting system is provided and users can give other users access to their data; read and write. Folders and files can be shared by link or by username (registration required).

\textbf{Encryption:} Data is stored encrypted with AES-256 and upload and download to the servers can be achieved with SSL. The main critique point is that Dropbox stores the decryption keys on the same servers where the files are stored and thus any administrator could have insight about the data.

\textbf{Trust \& Integrity:} There is no mechanism for trust except the user credentials. But as already mentioned, gaining access to the data is no big deal.

\textbf{Payment Scheme:} Freemium, base use is free, for more storage a paid subscription is available.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Dropbox Basic - free - 2 GB
	\item Dropbox Pro - 10 Euro / month - 1 TB
	\item Dropbox for Business - 12 Euro / month - unlimited
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Fairness:} Fairness is not applicable.

\textbf{Fault-tolerance and Availability:} Dropbox servers act as single point of failure.

\textbf{Type of Distribution:} Available through their website but GUI application also exists.

\textbf{Source code availability:} Closed source.

\textbf{User base:} Around 300 mio. (29.05.2014)\cite{dropbox:userbase}.

\textbf{Status:} Available for usage.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
In this section, we provide a summary about the topics mentioned above and draw conclusions about the current state of the available P2P file storage systems and what the future could hold for P2P file storage. The systems chosen are listed among their criteria and compared in a table and finally we will conclude our findings of the research.

The results of the research show that peer-to-peer developers have found many different solutions to face the problems that come up when developing and constructing such a system. Thus to simplify implementation almost exclusively there is always a specialization of the software for a specific use. To benefit from one aspect of peering scheme it might be inevitable to afford drawbacks and constraints in another aspect. Concrete one could imagine a slider going from e.g. left, Fault tolerance to right, Availability and every developer has to decide where to place his slider between because it is not possible to have them both on 100 percent. Publisher often care about a specific application area, e.g. business use or file synchronization and thus the 'sliders' have to been set as appropriate as possible for every system. Further a clear separation between file synchronization and file storage need to be made. P2P systems can do both but depending on the choice of specialization it does not always have to be the case.

As a conclusion of the facts described above peer-to-peer systems as well as client-server models do not solve all problems and requirements of file storage and synchronization. One has always to live with some constraints or privacy issues, e.g.: The huge gap between trusting a (well known) storage provider versus a (anominous) peer. Peer-to-peer does not automatically mean that the single point of failure problem is solved, many P2P systems are not really better than traditional cloud storage systems in this term. The 3rd generation DFS has to deal with a lot of problems traditional client-server models have already overcome e.g. peers are vulnerable to specific attacks, like sybil attacks etc.
